Gtk Widgets
===========

Some Gtk Widgets written by me (Victor A.).

Note:
  - None of these widgets depends on other widgets, the only dependency is Gtk+.
  - Each Widget has a example how to use, generally named `gtkwidget-example.c` for C, and `gtkwidget_example.py` for Python.
  - Some Widgets have a C and a Python version.
  - Copyright information can be found in respective Widget's source code.
