Gtk Widgets
===========

Some Gtk Widgets written by me (Victor A.).

Note:
  - Each Widget reside in a subdir named as widget name.
  - Each Widget has a example how to use, generally named `widget_example.vala` for Vala, and `widget_example.py` for Python.
  - Some Widgets builds the .typelib GI file, so you can use it from third languages like JavaScript, Python, Lua, and etc.
  - Some Widgets has a Vala and a Python version. (No other one will be added, since we have GI)
  - Copyright information can be found in respective Widget's source code.
